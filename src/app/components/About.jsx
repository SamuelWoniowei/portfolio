        ABOUT
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-5">
        I’m a software developer who’s all about creating solutions that don’t
        just look good but actually work (no “refresh and pray” vibes here).
        From crafting sleek user interfaces to diving into backend logic that
        sometimes feels like solving a puzzle with missing pieces, I’m
        passionate about building apps that are fast, functional, and genuinely
        helpful.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        I started as a frontend enthusiast, perfecting clean designs and making
        sure buttons do what they’re supposed to (because, let’s face it, they
        have one job). These days, I’m also exploring the backend world, where
        I’ve learned that databases have a personality—and it’s not always
        friendly. For me, it’s all about blending curiosity and creativity to
        build software that solves real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is always evolving, and so am I. Whether it’s experimenting
        with the latest tools, optimizing performance, or googling obscure error
        messages at odd hours, I’m committed to growing and delivering projects
        that surprise and delight. My goal? To make tech approachable,
        functional, and just a little magical—because the best software is the
        kind that makes you wonder how you ever lived without it.
